          My love affair with the internet began after my family ditched aol internet discs and got dial-up. Back then I was addicted to the internet because of MSN messenger... now I'm addicted because it's my job. Also for the memes.

          My friends and I created a service that allows students to buy and sell housing contracts on a private marketplace. It started as an excuse to hang out and has turned into something that a decent amount of people use. I have handled all of

          facebook marketplace.

          A physical video rental store, like blockbuster, but with 25,000 different movies. Old movies and formats meet new movies and formats, games and TV shows, all together under one roof. This was my first (real/retail) job, I've tried to quit
          three separate times. Two months after each attempt I wind up depressed and back on the schedule. It's a small family operation, technically not <em>my</em> family, but I'd claim them. If you're thinking – no this can't be, redbox killed
          them all, and then netflix robbed their graves – you're wrong. We have survived in large part due to our loyal community, our outstanding customer service, and our always-go-the-extra-mile employees.
