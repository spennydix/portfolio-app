We found that they had been showing some very out of date work from our in-house-agency and immediately started work on a site to pitch custom content, and house all our best work. The design process was iterative, more so than I would have liked, we had a lot of stakeholders for something that was just supposed to be an internal tool, but after 3 rounds of feedback working from a medium-fidelity adobe XD mockup, I started building the site. After it was all built, we threw it over to them and watched as they navigated... we simplified things, and pressed the publish button. It's one of the most used sites on the whole signed-out side of the business, now!"
