Our brand partners told us that was a big problem they were having, so we designed and delivered an experience that gave feedback for answers both correct and incorrect. It also gave them one of 5 unique ratings, for gamification. The design of this site fulfilled all the external goals of our parters, but also met many internal goals for content development.
