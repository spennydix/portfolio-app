I wont <em>mince</em> words they were awesome and ground-breaking, when compared to the other work we were doing.

Our brand partners told us that was a big problem they were having, so we designed and delivered an experience that gave feedback for answers both correct and incorrect. It also gave them one of 5 unique ratings, for gamification. The design of this site fulfilled all the external goals of our parters, but also met many internal goals for content development. With this we reset the expectation of what an edu-game could be, established new best practices of reinforcement and gamification.",
